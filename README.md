# OpenList Chrome Extension

OpenList provides tools you can use to manage lists of URLs. It's useful if you have a habit of emailing yourself lists of articles or pages to check out later.

With OpenList, you can...

* select a list of URLs (or search terms) in any web page or textarea, then open them all in new tabs
* paste a list of URLs (or search terms) into a popup, then open them all in new tabs
* get a list of all tabs in the current window

The name should probably be changed to somthing like TabsList, but that's a lot of effort.

## Download/Install

[Download the extension from the Chrome store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/nkpjembldfckmdchbdiclhfedcngbgnl). (It's free!)
